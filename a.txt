FCFS stands for First Come, First Served.
It is a type of scheduling algorithm. 
In this scheme, if a process requests the CPU first, it is allocated to the CPU first. 
Its implementation is managed by a FIFO queue.
It is simple and easy to understand & implement.
The process with less execution time suffer i.e. waiting time is often quite long.
This effect results in lower CPU and device utilization.
FCFS algorithm is particularly troublesome for time-sharing systems, where it is important that each user get a share of the CPU at regular intervals.
